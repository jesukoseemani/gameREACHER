##Introduction <br/><br/>
 A challenge was given to me by a senior developer which happens to be my mentor. He challenged me to build a website for game lovers, a place to see the newest games and to search for games. I took up the challenge which results in this project.<br/><br/>
I built this app with react, redux, router, and I used styled-components for the styling. I used an API from rawg.io to fetch the information. Thanks to font-awesome CSS Selector for the star- rendering.<br/><br/>
      
Because of the need to store data, I implemented Local storage concept to the app which works great.
